## LogIn Screen

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### Design 
I used this [login screen design](https://dribbble.com/shots/4612955-Recombee-Sign-In-Sign-Up) from by Franta Toman on Dribbble as a reference for this simple application.
